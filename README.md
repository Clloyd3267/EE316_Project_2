## Steps to Create Quartus II 13.0 Project

1.) Open Quartus II 13.0 and create a new project (in an empty folder) named "memory_pwm_generator_top" with no
    files added, and any device. (these will be overwritten in from the committed Quartus Project Settings (.qsf)
    file)
2.) Close Quartus and copy all source files into the folder. This includes the following files:

- All files in each "initial_development" folder
- Both files in the "final_design" folder (memory_pwm_generator_top.qsf will ask if you want to overwrite the one
  there. ACCEPT THIS!)

3.) Reopen Quartus II 13.0 and open the project (can launch from the "memory_pwm_generator_top.qpf" file)

4.) Compile!
